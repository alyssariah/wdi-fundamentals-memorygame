			Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.
		</p><br><br>
		<p>You will have to find exact matches. For example, Queen of Diamonds only matches with Queen of Diamonds (<b>NOT</b> the Queen of Hearts). After every mismatch pair you find, you must push the Flip Back Over button to continue. Once you find a match, the match will remain flipped over and you can continue to find other matches. For every match you find, you gain a point. For every mismatch, you will lose a point.
